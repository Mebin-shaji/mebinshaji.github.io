<h4 class="about">About W3C</h4>
<p class="pw3c">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations which maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 21 October 2019, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 443 members. The consortium also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.</p>

<h3 class="about" id="history">History</h3>
<hr>
<p class="pw3c">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet.[3] It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with CSAIL, to the Stata Center.[4]
	The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.
	It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) becoming the Asian host in September 1996.[5] Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.[6]
	In October 2012, W3C convened a community of major web players and publishers to establish a MediaWiki wiki that seeks to document open web standards called the WebPlatform and WebPlatform Docs.
	In January 2013, Beihang University became the Chinese host.</p>

	<h3 class="about" id="specificationmaturation">Specification maturation</h3>
<hr>
<p class="pw3c">Sometimes, when a specification becomes too large, it is split into independent modules which can mature at their own pace. Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and are denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on each level are denoted by an integer following a decimal point (for example, CSS2.1 = Revision 1).
	The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.[7]</p>

	<h4 class="about" id="workingdraft(WD)">Working draft (WD)</h4>
<p class="pw3c">After enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. A WD document is the first form of a standard that is publicly available. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.[7]
	At this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.[7]</p>

	<h4 class="about" id="candidaterecommendation(CR)">Candidate recommendation (CR)</h4>
	<p class="pw3c">A candidate recommendation is a version of a standard that is more mature than the WD. At this point, the group responsible for the standard is satisfied that the standard meets its goal. The purpose of the CR is to elicit aid from the development community as to how implementable the standard is.[7]
		The standard document may change further, but at this point, significant features are mostly decided. The design of those features can still change due to feedback from implementors.[7]</p>
